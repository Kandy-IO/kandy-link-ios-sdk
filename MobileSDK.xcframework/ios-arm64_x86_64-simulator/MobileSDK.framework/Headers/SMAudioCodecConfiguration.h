 * or in cases where only constant bitrate is available, the Opus encoder can use Discontinuous
 * Transmission (DTX), where parts of the encoded signal that correspond to periods of silence
 * in the input speech or audio signal are not transmitted to the receiver.
 * A receiver can distinguish between DTX and packet loss by looking for gaps in the
 * sequence number. On default DTX is disabled and enabling DTX will cause less bandwidth usage
 * (For further information check RFC-7587).

 * in higher than necessary network usage and encoding complexity, so an encoder SHOULD NOT
 * encode frequencies above the audio bandwidth specified by maxplaybackrate.
