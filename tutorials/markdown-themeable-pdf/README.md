# How to Create PDF from Markdown?

1. Install Atom editor from: [Atom Editor](https://atom.io "Atom Editor")

2. Install `Markdown-themeable-pdf` package from: [markdown-themeable-pdf](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf)

3. Open `.md` file with Atom Editor, then click right and choose `Markdown to PDF` or press Control+Shift+E
4. PDF converter automatically uses style files located in `markdown-themeable-pdf` folder in the current path, but if more than one markdown file is opened, wrong style files can be used. Thus, check header, footer and style.css file formats and verify correct files are used after conversion.
5. If PDF contains wrong styles, quit from `Atom` and **only** open markdown file which you will convert to PDF.
